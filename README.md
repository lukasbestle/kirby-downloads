## About this plugin

This plugin is for you if you manage a site with lots of downloads (e.g. product documentation or brochures) that should be stored in a central location (on a single downloads page) but presented throughout the site (e.g. on individual product pages).

## Features

- Pre-selection of files by the value of file fields (automatic filters) or manually from the list of all files
- Optional additional filters for visitors in the site frontend
- Optional full-text search across the file title
- Frontend filters and search are implemented without JavaScript but can be progressively enhanced with a built-in API route (requires Kirby 3.9.2+)

## Requirements

- Kirby 3.8.0+
- PHP 8.0+

## Documentation

The [plugin documentation](https://github.com/lukasbestle/kirby-downloads/wiki) will show you how to set up the plugin initially, how to configure the file source and filter fields and how to use the plugin.
